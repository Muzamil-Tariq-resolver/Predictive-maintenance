        "\n",
        "Temperature analysis showed that failures tend to occur under elevated thermal conditions and reduced temperature differences between process and ambient air, suggesting that cooling efficiency plays an important role in machine reliability. Mechanical variables such as rotational speed and torque revealed that failures are more likely when machines operate outside their typical load ranges, particularly at extreme combinations rather than at nominal operating points. Tool wear analysis indicated that failures become more frequent at higher wear levels, highlighting the impact of cumulative degradation over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Multivariate exploration demonstrated that failures are not driven by a single factor but emerge under specific combinations of thermal stress, mechanical load, and wear. These interactions indicate that raw sensor values alone may not fully capture the physical conditions leading to failure.\n",

        "- Derivation of physics-informed features (e.g., temperature difference, power-related metrics).\n",
        "- Scaling and normalization of continuous variables to ensure comparability across sensors.\n",
        "- Careful handling of class imbalance due to the low overall failure rate.\n",
        "- Preparation of features suitable for both binary and multi-class failure prediction.\n",
